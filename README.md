My name is Alfa.

I'm a undergraduate student in electrical engineering at Federal University of ParÃ¡ (UFPA).

When the Rangers aren't getting themselves in trouble, I like to dabble a little with R and to study computational intelligence.

Iâ€™m currently enrolled at the fourth cohort of [Front-End Foxes School](https://github.com/frontendfoxes) ðŸ¦Š
